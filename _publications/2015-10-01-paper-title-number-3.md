In this work, we show how one can obtain a large blue spectral index even with a quartic potential term associated with the Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking radial partner. We use the fact that a large radial direction with a quartic term can naturally induce a conformal limit which generates an isocurvature spectral index of 3. We point out that this conformal representation is intrinsically different from both the ordinary equilibrium axion scenario or massless fields in Minkowski spacetime.
