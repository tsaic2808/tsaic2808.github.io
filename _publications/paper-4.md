We present a Fisher forecast for the Euclid and MegaMapper (MM) experiments in their ability to detect blue isocurvature perturbations. 
We construct the theoretical predictions in the EFTofLSS and bias expansion formalisms 
at quartic order in overdensities which allows us to compute the power spectrum at 
one loop order and bispectrum at tree level and further include theoretical error 
at the next to leading order for the covariance determination.  We find that Euclid is 
expected to provide at least a factor of few improvement on the isocurvature spectral amplitude 
compared to the existing Planck constraints for large spectral indices while MM is expected to 
provide about 1 to 1.5 order of magnitude improvement for a broad range of spectral indices.
