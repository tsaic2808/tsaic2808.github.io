  <div style="flex: 1;">
    I am a **postdoctoral fellow specializing in theoretical cosmology**, currently based at Indiana University, Bloomington. I earned my **doctorate in Physics** from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA. My research focuses on exploring the interplay between early-universe physics and late-universe observables, bridging theoretical cosmology with observational astrophysical data analysis. 
    
  My interests span a range of topics, including **axion cosmology, out-of-equilibrium systems in the early universe, isocurvature perturbations, inflation and primordial perturbations, non-gaussianity, large-scale structure formation, EFTofLSS-based analysis, primordial black holes, and gravitational wave phenomenology**.
